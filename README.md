# Peacekeeper Bot

An autonomous, Nerf-firing UGV designed to detect, track, and engage red balloon targets using basic sensors, OpenCV, and a Raspberry Pi + Arduino combo.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Peacekeeper Bot is a low-cost, multisensor robotic turret platform built for autonomous object detection and engagement. The bot uses computer vision to detect red balloons, aims using servo-driven control, and fires Nerf darts with precision. Its core system is powered by a Raspberry Pi (for vision and high-level control) and an Arduino (for actuation and motor control).

## 🎯 Features

- Autonomous roaming and obstacle avoidance using a VL53L0X ToF sensor
- Object recognition and target tracking via OpenCV
- Dynamic state management (roaming, aiming, shooting, pausing)
- Serial communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino
- Shooting mechanism driven by Hitec servo motors and a Nerf blaster
- Command interface supporting:
  - `a`: roam
  - `s`: stop
  - `FIRE`: fire
  - `SLx` / `SRx`: slow left/right turn for x milliseconds

## 🧪 Test Summary

| Test | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Drive & rotate | Forward and CCW motion | ✅ (Theoretical due to hardware failure) |
| Obstacle detection | Detect object within 120–330mm | ✅ |
| Obstacle avoidance | Turn and continue | ✅ (Theoretical) |
| Object classification | Detect balloon vs. human | ✅ |
| Color detection | Red vs. blue balloons | ✅ |
| Aim | Align crosshair with red balloon | ✅ (Theoretical) |
| Fire | Hit red balloon | ✅ |

> ⚠️ One motor burnt out during testing, so movement was simulated.
